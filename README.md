# Finite-Automata-in-C
Project for Formal Systems Course

Implement deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that recognize the following lan- guages:
(a) Exactly the string ab
(b) Any string that starts with the characters ab
(c) Binary input with an even number of 1’s
(d) Binary input with an even number of both 0’s and 1’s
(e) At least one other pattern that you think is interesting (and hopefully different from other students’)
Implement non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs) that recognize the following languages:
(a) Strings ending in man
(b) Strings with more than one a, g, h, i, o, s, t, or w, or more than two n’s. That is, no string that it accepts can be the string “washington”, although it may accept strings that are not “washington”.
(c) At least one other pattern that you think is interesting (and hopefully different from other students’)
Implement a translator that receives as input an NFA and produces as output a DFA. That is, a DFA is represented using a data structure in your code for Question 1. Similarly an NFA is represented using a different data structure in your code for Question 2. For this question, you need to convert an instance of the second data structure into a new instance of the first.
